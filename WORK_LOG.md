# Work log - where we keep track of what we've done

## Vite Scaffolding
- **Scaffolded project with Vite**: Converted from standalone React component to full Vite project
- **Created project structure**: 
  - `src/` directory with proper React entry points
  - `src/components/ui/` for reusable UI components
  - `src/App.jsx` moved from root `app.js`
- **Added build tooling**:
  - Vite configuration with React plugin
  - Tailwind CSS setup with PostCSS
  - ESLint configuration for React
  - Path aliases (`@/` → `src/`)
- **Created UI components**:
  - `Card` and `CardContent` components
  - `Button` component with proper styling
- **Added dependencies**:
  - React 18, React DOM
  - Framer Motion for animations
  - React Confetti for celebration effects
  - Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer
  - ESLint and related plugins
- **Development server**: Running on http://localhost:5173/

## Added Cursor Rules
- **Created `.cursorrules` file**: Added project-specific rules for Cursor AI
- **Work log rule**: Enforced requirement to write to `WORK_LOG.md` after any changes
- **Code style guidelines**: Added rules for consistent formatting and React best practices
- **Project structure rules**: Defined organization for components and imports

## Updated Work Log Format
- **Removed dates**: Simplified format to just show newest entries at the bottom
- **Cleaner structure**: Easier to read and maintain

## UI Improvements
- **Fixed round title text color**: Changed "Round 1: Do you ENJOY this skill?" and "Round 2: Are you GOOD at this skill?" text from white to black by adding `text-black` class to the h1 element in `src/App.jsx`
- Updated the summary screen button layout:
  - Made 'Copy Shareable Link' and 'Do it again' buttons appear side by side (horizontal row)
  - Set 'Copy Shareable Link' as the primary button
  - Set 'Do it again' as the secondary (outline) button
  - Affected file: src/App.jsx
- Updated the round title in `src/App.jsx` so that 'ENJOY' is blue in round 1 and 'GOOD' is green in round 2, using Tailwind classes for color. Only the word itself is colored, not the rest of the sentence.

## CSS Fixes
- **Removed default text color from :root**: Deleted the `color` property from the `:root` selector in `src/index.css` to allow Tailwind's text color utilities to work as expected throughout the app.
- **Fixed React hook order error in SkillSorter**:
  - Moved useWindowSize hook to always be called at the top level of the SkillSorter component in src/App.jsx
  - Now only uses window size values conditionally, preventing violation of the Rules of Hooks
  - This resolves the 'Rendered more hooks than during the previous render' error after answering all cards

## Card Centering Fix
- Fixed the falling card's horizontal alignment so it now appears perfectly centered on the screen
- Updated the motion.div in `src/App.jsx` to use `left: 50%` and `transform: translateX(-50%)` for true centering

## Card Centering Fix (Follow-up)
- Removed the inline `style={{ transform: 'translateX(-50%)' }}` from the card's motion.div in `src/App.jsx`
- Now only using Tailwind's `-translate-x-1/2` class for centering, allowing Framer Motion's `x` animation to work correctly

## Card Centering Fix (True Middle)
- Updated the card's motion.div in `src/App.jsx` so the initial x position is 0 (true center)
- Now the random offsetX is only applied in the animate prop when the card is falling, ensuring it falls from the true middle and lands with horizontal variation

## Card Centering Fix (Framer Motion Only)
- Switched to using only Framer Motion for horizontal centering and offset of the card in `src/App.jsx`
- Removed `-translate-x-1/2` from the className and used `x: '-50%'` in initial and `x: calc(${offsetX}px - 50%)` in animate for the falling state
- This avoids transform order conflicts and ensures the card falls from the true center

## Favicon Setup
- Created `public/` directory for static assets
- Added custom SVG favicon (`public/favicon.svg`) with modern blue gradient design
- Updated `index.html` to reference `/favicon.svg` instead of non-existent `/vite.svg`
- Favicon features layered geometric shapes representing skill organization concept

## Skill List Refactoring
- **Created `src/data/skills.js`**: Moved the skills array from `src/App.jsx` to its own dedicated data file
- **Updated imports**: Added import statement for skills in `src/App.jsx`
- **Renamed variable**: Changed `tasks` to `skills` throughout the codebase for better clarity
- **Improved code organization**: Separated data concerns from component logic for better maintainability

- Implemented shareable results using Base64-encoded JSON in a query parameter in `src/App.jsx`.
- Added a 'Copy Shareable Link' button to the summary screen, which encodes the user's results and copies a shareable URL to the clipboard.
- On app load, the app checks for a `data` query parameter, decodes and parses it, and if valid, displays the summary screen with those results (bypassing the quiz).
- Added error handling to show a friendly message if the link is invalid or corrupted.
- No backend required; all logic is client-side for easy sharing and privacy.

- Enhanced Button component in src/components/ui/button.jsx:
  - Added 'variant' prop to support 'outline' (secondary) style
  - Outline style: blue border, blue text, white background, blue border/text on hover
  - Default remains primary (blue background, white text)
  - Enables proper primary/secondary button distinction on summary screen
- Fixed bug where no skills appeared when loading a shareable link
    - Updated src/App.jsx to hydrate skill names from the link into full skill objects for quadrant display
    - Ensures Quadrant UI renders correctly for shared results
- Updated `src/App.jsx`:
  - Modified the `restart` function to clear URL params by resetting the URL to its base path when 'Do it again' is clicked after visiting a shared link.
  - This ensures that the app starts fresh and does not reload shared data from the URL.
  - Modified the `restart` function to also reset `summaryOverride` to null.
  - This ensures that after starting over from a shared link, the app does not use old summary data and a new run is truly fresh.

## Skill Quadrants Summary Refactoring
- **Created `src/components/SkillQuadrantsSummary.jsx`**: Extracted the entire summary screen logic and UI into its own dedicated component
- **Moved components and logic**:
  - Quadrant component (with color-coded rings)
  - useWindowSize hook for confetti sizing
  - encodeBase64 helper function for shareable links
  - Shareable link generation and copy functionality
  - Confetti animation and celebration effects
- **Updated `src/App.jsx`**:
  - Removed duplicated summary screen code (Quadrant component, shareable link logic, confetti)
  - Added import for SkillQuadrantsSummary component
  - Simplified summary screen rendering to just return `<SkillQuadrantsSummary summary={summary} onRestart={restart} />`
  - Removed unused imports (Confetti)
- **Improved code organization**: Summary screen is now a clean, reusable component with clear props interface
- **Maintained all functionality**: Confetti, shareable links, quadrant animations, and restart functionality all preserved

- Added MINI_STACK_SIZE constant and upcomingCards variable to SkillSorter in src/App.jsx
  - This prepares the component to display a mini stack of the next 4 cards after the current card
  - No UI changes yet; just data extraction for the upcoming stack
- Added mini stack UI to the sorting screen in src/App.jsx
  - Renders the next 4 upcoming cards as smaller, offset cards behind the main card
  - Uses absolute positioning, scaling, and fading for a stacked visual effect
  - Each mini card shows only the card name and is non-interactive
- Added a 'cards left' counter below the mini stack in src/App.jsx
  - Displays the number of cards remaining in the current round as a small badge
  - Placed below the mini stack for extra clarity and motivation
- Added Framer Motion animation to the mini stack in src/App.jsx
  - Each mini card now animates its position, scale, and opacity as the stack shifts forward
  - Creates a smooth transition effect when a card is removed, enhancing visual feedback
- Fixed the mini stack's vertical position in src/App.jsx
  - Adjusted top and translate-y so the stack is visually centered behind the main card
  - Used the same approach as previous card centering fixes for consistency
- Fixed the mini stack's position to match the main card's centering logic in src/App.jsx
  - Changed the mini stack container to use 'absolute top-0 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2' for perfect alignment
  - Removed vertical translation and top-1/2, so the stack sits directly behind the main card
- Fixed mini stack alignment behind the main card in src/App.jsx
  - Introduced BASE_Y to match the main card's default y position
  - Each mini card's y is now BASE_Y + i * 12, so the stack visually aligns with the main card regardless of screen size
- Added static card description at the bottom center of the screen in src/App.jsx
  - Displays the current card's description in a styled box for better readability while the card is animating
  - Only shown when a card is active (not on summary or error screens)
- Removed the card subheader (description) from the card itself in src/App.jsx
  - The description now only appears as static text at the bottom of the screen
- Updated Enjoy and Good progress bars to have visually distinct colors in src/App.jsx
  - Enjoy is blue, Good is green, making it easy to tell which phase you're in
- Updated the 'cards left' badge color to match the current phase in src/App.jsx
  - Blue for Enjoy phase, green for Good phase, for better visual feedback

- Added an 'emoji' property to each skill object in src/data/skills.js for visual distinction.
- Updated src/App.jsx to render the emoji before the skill name on the main card and mini stack.
- Updated src/components/SkillQuadrantsSummary.jsx to render the emoji before the skill name in the summary quadrant lists.

## Variable Speed Card Flying with Power Bar System
- **Created PowerBar component** (`src/components/ui/PowerBar.jsx`):
  - Modern power meter with gradient fill (blue to red)
  - Smooth animations with Framer Motion
  - Shows power percentage and fills up during key press

- **Enhanced keyboard input system** in `src/App.jsx`:
  - Replaced simple keydown with keydown/keyup tracking
  - Added press duration calculation (0-1000ms for full power)
  - Real-time power level updates at 60fps during key press
  - Power level affects animation speed and visual effects
- **Variable animation speeds**:
  - Short press (< 300ms): Slow fly-off (0.8s duration)
  - Long press (≥ 300ms): Fast fly-off (0.2s duration)
  - Linear interpolation between speeds based on power level
  - Enhanced rotation and scale effects based on power
- **Visual feedback enhancements**:
  - Card glows and scales during power charging
  - Rotation intensity increases with power level
  - Dynamic shadow effects that intensify with power
  - Smooth transitions between different power states
- **Updated user instructions**:
  - Changed from "Press" to "Hold" to indicate new interaction
  - Added "(longer = faster!)" hint for power system

  - Proper cleanup of power state when advancing cards or restarting
  - Reset power system when moving between rounds

## Intensity Tracking and Sorting System
- **Added intensity state management** in `src/App.jsx`:
  - Added `likeIntensity` and `goodIntensity` state objects to store power levels
  - Updated `handleVote` function to save power level as intensity value
  - Power level (0-100) represents how strongly user feels about each skill
- **Enhanced summary data structure**:
  - Added intensity data to summary object with enjoy/good/total values
  - Each skill now tracks both Enjoy and Good intensity separately
  - Total intensity calculated as sum of both values for overall strength
- **Updated URL sharing system**:
  - Modified `getShareUrl` in `SkillQuadrantsSummary.jsx` to include intensity data
  - Updated URL loading logic to restore intensity values from shared links
  - Intensity data is now preserved when sharing results
- **Enhanced quadrant display**:
  - Updated `Quadrant` component to accept and display intensity data
  - Skills are now sorted by total intensity (highest first) within each quadrant
  - Added intensity percentage display with color coding:
    - Red (80%+): Very strong feelings
    - Orange (60-79%): Strong feelings  
    - Yellow (40-59%): Moderate feelings
    - Blue (20-39%): Mild feelings
    - Gray (0-19%): Weak feelings
- **Improved user experience**:
  - Users can now see how strongly they feel about each skill
  - Most impactful skills appear at the top of each quadrant
  - Visual intensity indicators help identify key strengths and weaknesses
  - Shared links preserve the emotional intensity of decisions
- Normalized the skill intensity percentages in the summary screen to show values out of 100% (average of enjoy and good intensities), instead of allowing values over 100%.
- Updated `src/components/SkillQuadrantsSummary.jsx` to use the normalized value for both display and color coding in the Quadrant component.

## Start Page Implementation
- **Created `src/components/StartPage.jsx`**: New landing page component with beautiful design and animations
  - Features app title, description, and explanation of the two-round process
